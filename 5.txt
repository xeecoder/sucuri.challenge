I will follow the steps below to debug this problem:

1) Will check application or framework logs for possible exceptions and cause
2) Will check if this commit has overwritten any .htaccess files
3) Will check web server logs for possible errors
4) Will run the live mock in debug mode (using framework configuration or enabling php error directives) 
5) Will run the live mock with partial commits of changes to see what commit did the destruction
