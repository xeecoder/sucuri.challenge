pass field will require hashing before it is stored in DB. 
This will ensure user password is not leaked in case of a possuble DB hijack (external or internal)
I will use PHP password_hash as follows:

if (isset( $_POST['pass']) &&  $_POST['pass'] != '') {
    $options = [
      'cost' => 11,
      'salt' => 'd1RtyLiTtL35ecr3T',
    ];
    $dbPasswordHash = password_hash($_POST['pass'], PASSWORD_BCRYPT, $options)
}

In addition to that both pass and user fields requires to be validated again using the underlying validation rules of the system
